Multi-Hop reasoning is a typical sequential decision problem, which can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Subsequently, some reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches are proposed and proven effective to train an agent for reasoning paths sequentially until reaching the target answer. However, these approaches assume that an entity/relation representation follows a one-point distribution. In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties. On the other hand, since REINFORCE used for updating the policy in these approaches is a biased policy gradients method, the agent is prone to be stuck in high reward paths rather than broad reasoning paths, which leads to premature and suboptimal exploitation. In this paper, we consider a Bayesian reinforcement learning paradigm to harness uncertainty into multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating uncertainty into the representation layer, the agent trained by RL has uncertainty in a region of the state space then it should be more efficient in exploring unknown or less known part of the KG. In our approach, we build a Bayesian Q-learning architecture as a state-action value function for estimating the expected long-term reward. As initialized by Gaussian prior or pre-trained prior distribution, the representation layer drives uncertainty that allows regularizing the training. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple KGs. Experimental results show a superior performance than other baselines, especially significant improvements on the automated extracted KG.}, number={5}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wan, Guojia and Du, Bo}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={4393-4401} }

abstract = {Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system. Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087 and 1118 AlphaZero teaches itself to play three different board games and beats state-of-the-art programs in each. The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.}}

abstract = {Link prediction for knowledge graphs is the task of predicting missing relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models-which potentially limits performance. In this work we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with 8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree - which are common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being present in the test set -however, the extent of this issue has so far not been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly used datasets - deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously proposed models, and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal Rank across all datasets.},
